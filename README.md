# LEO-Q Framework

LEO-Q is a research framework for evaluating latency-aware, quantum-secured
financial message routing using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks.

The framework focuses on decision-critical financial workflows where
end-to-end latency, tail risk, and cryptographic overhead directly impact
execution quality and risk exposure.

## Problem Context
Modern financial systems rely on terrestrial fiber and internet routing
that suffer from unpredictable latency, congestion, and growing
post-quantum security overheads. These limitations are especially acute
for cross-region trading, risk aggregation, and time-sensitive execution.

## Key Idea
LEO-Q evaluates whether LEO satellite-assisted routing combined with
latency-aware decision logic and post-quantum security modeling can
reduce end-to-end decision latency while preserving cryptographic safety.

## What This Repository Contains
- Reproducible latency and routing simulations
- Baseline models for terrestrial routing
- LEO-assisted routing strategies
- Post-quantum cryptographic overhead models
- Benchmark scripts and result artifacts

## Status
This repository is under active development.
A reference implementation and evaluation report will be released incrementally.

## Reproducibility
Detailed instructions for reproducing experiments will be provided
in the `/docs` directory.
